**Due at 4:59pm on Monday, 9/26/2016**

Name: Rushil Vora

ONID ID: 932-350-583

This assignment is intended to get you up and running with some of the tools we'll be using in this course.  It should be very straightforward.  It has two parts.

## 1. Sign up for Piazza

Use this link to sign up for CS 261 on Piazza using your ONID email address: https://piazza.com/oregonstate/fall2016/cs261

We'll be using Piazza in this course for Q&A because it's geared towards students helping other students with the class.  Anyone can post or answer a question on Piazza, even anonymously, and the instructor and TAs can revise and endorse student answers, which means you can be confident in the quality of the response.

You are *strongly encouraged* to post any class-related querstions to Piazza first instead of emailing the instructor or TAs.  You should also get in the habit of checking in to Piazza to answer other students' questions.  This will not only enable everyone to get help quickly, but it will also help you improve your understanding of the material, since teaching someone else is the best way to learn something.

As an incentive to use Piazza, extra credit will be awarded to the most active Piazza participants at the end of the class.

## 2. Use Git and GitHub

The other tool we'll be using quite a bit for this course is Git/GitHub.  You're already here looking at this assignment, so we know you've got at least some Git/GitHub skills.  Practice a little more by following these steps:

1. If you're new to Git and GitHub, take a few minutes to follow these two tutorials:
  * Git: https://try.github.io/
  * GitHub: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

  We'll be using Git and GitHub heavily in this course, so it'll pay off to put in the time now to learn how to use them.

2. Commit and push a change to this `README.md` file in which you replace `NAME` and `ONID_ID` above with your actual name and ONID ID.

3. Add, commit, and push a new file `about_me.md` that contains these details:
  * Your name and what you prefer to be called (if it's different)
  * Your major and year of study
  * The answer to this question: have you signed up for Piazza?
  * A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had.  Include only what you can think of and write down in two minutes, maximum.
  
  You can refer to this brief guide on Markdown (essentially enhanced `.txt`) for formatting help: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/.

4. Add, commit, and push a new file `me.jpg` (or `me.png` or whatever image format you have) containing a photo with a clear picture of your face.

## Submission

Submit the assignment via GitHub Classroom by the due date above.

## Grading criteria

The assignment is worth 100 total points, broken down as follows:
* 50 points: Signed up for Piazza
* 50 points: Followed the instructions for using Git/GitHub
  * 10 points: Updated `README.md` with the right info
